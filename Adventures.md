![Adventures](/assets/img/Hiking.png)

Beyond my life as an engineer where I am glued to a computer, I am an avid 
outdoorsman. I enjoy rock climbing, backpacking, mountain biking, and love the 
call to adventure. I enjoy being outside and need the peace from the relessness 
of daily life. It's not that I don't like being around people, it's just hard to 
beat not hearing the noise of the anthropocene.
