## TANSA

I had the distinct pleasure of being part of the Texas A&M National Scholar Ambassadors (TANSA) for four years during my undergrad. TANSA serves as a recruiting organization for high acheiving national scholars under the office of admissions. I was actively a part of this organization, starting out as a member, then social chair, and slowly rising to take on the role as president. From it's role in my on campus community, to the ability for me to give back to the school that gave me such a fantastic opportunity, TANSA has been a fantastic part of my life and I will always look back on it fondly. 

## Aggie Westies

Coming to A&M, I discovered the amazingly wonderful dance that is West Coast Swing. I have loved being a part of the Aggie Westies club where we meet weekly to practice and social dance. The people I have me have been nothing but phenomenal, and I will definitely continue my dancing far into the future. I served as the club treasurer for a few years to help keep things in order, and was able to help organize one of the largest swing dance events College Station will likely see for a long time.
