<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    My name is Jacob Hartzer, and I am a Mechanical Engineering PhD Student. I am originally from Austin, Texas, and also attended Texas A&M for my undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering. My background interests were originally in controls and dynamics, which has slowly led me to estimation and filtering. My professional and research experience has also given me avenues to use coding skills to apply these interests to real-wrold problems
</p>

<h2>Current Research</h2>
<p>
    Currently, I am researching collaborative localization techniques for networks of autonomous vehicles. My goal is to leverage the large number of vehicles within sensor range to increase localization accuracies of the network. I am currently simulating Ultra Wideband (UWB) ranging modules to provide vehicle-to-vehicle measurements which, when combined, can reduce the overall uncertainty in the network. I am also interested in determining how these UWB ranging modules can be used to aid in GPS-denied environments, such as indoor-to-outdoor transition sites, or in collaborative situations between ground and air vehicles.    
</p>

<h2>Abilities</h2>
<p>
    Most of my work focuses on the simulation and estimation of complex dynamic systems. I spend much of my time in work and research coding custom models in a number of environments. This has allowed me to contribute to more accurate estimation and localization of these systems and improve the development of new devices with more accurate models.
